Starting out on a project to completely build a goto unit for a mobile observatory
Purpose of this project, can show folks that astrophotography does not have to be an expensive hobby
Components of this are
-Power Distribution and Power issues
-Computer setup 
-Interface Setup between the computer and the telescope and build between the telescope and the computer
- want to give a shout out to https://github.com/kevinferrare/arduino-st4/ for the inspiration.
I am using Kevin's instructions for the ST4 setup for the motor controller, and modified that to a RJ232 controller
 -want to give a shout out to https://github.com/Gordon999/Pi-AutoGuider/blob/master/ST-4_interface%20IL74.jpg for some of the build
